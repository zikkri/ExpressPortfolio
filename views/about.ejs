        <h2>about me</h2>
        my name is zack bowker, and I am a software engineering student at centennial college.
        I am in my third semester and am hoping to graduate this decemeber. 
        I enjoy web design, programming and database related work. the programming languages I have been working with are c#, javascript, and java. I hope one day to be able to be a full-stack developer, and potentially open my own business/freelance and work for myself. in my personal life, I enjoy video games, cooking, reading, and hanging out with my cats. I have two little meows, one named naya and another named jam. naya is sweet and polite, where jam is erratic and crazy. that about sums it up for me, I hope you enjoy my portfolio site!
